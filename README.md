# My-First-Repository
This is a practice assignment

This is a story all about how
My life Got Flipped turned upside down
I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you a story how I got flipped in the air
(Cause I'm a pancake)
The ground trembled.
My soul was shook.
The sky began to fall.
No peace within this book.
Life without you is nothing at all.
